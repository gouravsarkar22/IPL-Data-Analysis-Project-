# **IPL Data Analysis (2008-2024)**




 **Overview** - 
 
 The project is a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Indian Premier League (IPL) matches from 2008 to 2024. The goal was to uncover patterns, trends, and 
insights about team performances, player consistency, and match dynamics using Python data analysis and visualization tools.
The project demonstrates my ability to:
1. Work with real-world sports data.
2. Perform cleaning, wrangling and exploratory analysis.
3. Use visualization to communicate insights effectively.


**Objectives** -
1. Understand team performance across IPL seasons and title contenders.
2. Identify top-performing players (batsmen and bowlers) using aggregate statistics.
3. Analyze match dynamics through over-by-over analysis.
4. How match momentum shifts during different phases of play.
5. Communicate insights visually with professional plots and charts.


**Problem Statement** -

With thousands of matches played, it is hard to manually track:
1. Which teams have been consistently successful?
2. Which players have shaped the league historically?
3. How do overs (PowerPlay, Middle, Death) influence match outcomes?

**Dataset** -

Dataset includes match-level details from IPL seasons 2008-2024. Contains information on runs, wickets, overs, teams, overs, and player stats.



**Approach** -

-> Data Cleaning : Removed missing values, standardized team names, and fixed inconsistencies.

-> Data Wrangling : Created derived metrics like (e.g., win rates, average runs per over).

-> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) : Aggregated stats to identify trends. Visualized patterns season by season.





**Key Features** -

1. Team Success Rate Analysis:

   -> Calculated win ratio across seasons.
   
   -> Identified consistently successful teams.

   -> How toss decisions impact the match results.

2. Top Player Performance:

   -> Ranked batsmen and bowlers using runs, wickets, strike rates, fielding, and averages.

    -> Highlighted key players players who had long-term impact.

3. Over-by-over Match Analysis:

   -> Explored momentum swings in matches by studying runs and wickets ball-by-ball.

   -> Visualized how strategies (PowerPlay and Death overs) affect outcomes.

4. Data Visualization:

   -> Created bar charts, line graphs, scatterplot, pie chart and heatmaps to communicate findings.

   -> Designed plots for season-by-season comparisons.




**Tools & Libraries**

-> Python - main programming language.

-> Pandas & NumPy - data cleaning, wrangling, and aggregation.

-> Matplotlib & Seaborn - data visualization and exploratory charts. 




**Insights & Findings** -
1. A handful of franchises consistently maintained above-average win ratios, showing strong team building strategies, where Gujrat Titans, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Kolkata Knight
   Riders, and Chennai Super Kings; these teams are most consistent in winning most of the matches across the seasons.
2. Mumbai Indians and Chennai Super Kings are the most title contenders, having equal number of titles; followed by Kolkata Knight Riders just two titles left to make the most successful
   equalizer.
3. Across the 17 seasons most high-scoring batsmen who are mostly consistent in run making are Virat Kohli (with the highest scorer) followed by Shikhar Dhawan, Rohit Sharma, David Warner
   and so on. Top 3 highest scorers are Indian players.
4. In a particular match most devastating performance was given by Chris Gayle with a phenomenal strike rate, followed by AB de Villiers and Brandon McCullum.
5. Across the 17 seasons, Yuzvendra Chahal is the highest wicket taker, followed by Piyush Chawla, DJ Bravo, and Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, whostood out as game-changers acros multiple seasons.
6. With respect to venues, Mumbai had been chosen as the host for most number of times, followed by Kolkata, Delhi, and Chennai.
7. Most number of dismissals happened with catches, followed by bowled outs and run outs.
8. MS Dhoni was the top fielder along with keeping across the seasons, followed by Dinesh Karthik, Ab de Villiers, Robin Uthappa, and Virat Kohli.
9. A peak in run scoring has been seen during PowerPlays and Death overs (16-20) are the most decisive, often flipping match outcomes despite early dominance.
10. Most of the time extra runs were given during either early overs or during death overs.
11. Most of the wickets were taken during death overs.
12. Toss decisions are the most important factor for a cricket match, where most of the captains have been decided to field first, after winning the toss.
13. Top partnerships which came out as game changing moments, had been performed by Sunrisers Hyderavbad and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, followed by Kolakta Knight Riders.
14. AB de Villiers and CH Gayle had won Player of the Match Award most of the times.
15. In 2019 and 2020 most of the matches went to super overs as decisive innings. The teams mostly involved in super overs are Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad and Punjab Kings.
16. Matches Which had been won by the smallest number of wickets in hand, by mostly Kolkata Knight Riders, followed by Chennai Super Kings, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Lucknow Supergiants.
17. Over the years, scoring patterns have shifted upward, reflecting aggresive batting strategies in modern T20 cricket.
